# Chat-80 port to Ciao

This is a port of Chat-80 to Ciao packaged as a Ciao bundle. Usage:

    $ ciao get github.com/jfmc/chat80
    $ ~/.ciao/build/bin/chat80

You can install [Ciao](http://github.com/ciao-lang/ciao) directly from source
or using Homebrew (`brew tap
ciao-lang/ciao`, `brew install --HEAD ciao`).

Chat-80 was a prototype natural language question answering system
developed by David H. D. Warren and Fernando Pereira in 1982. See
the original [paper][1] for a more detailed description (recovered from the
[web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J82/J82-3002.pdf)).
